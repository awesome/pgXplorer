pgXplorer
---------
pgXplorer is a freely downloadable, ISC licensed administation client for PostgreSQL versions 8.4 and above.

Key features are per-database instances, multithreaded queries and an intuitive UI and an SQL console that supports syntax highlighting and much more.

pgXplorer is built using Qt. Minimum version of Qt required is 4.7.

Additionally, for Windows and Mac, you need to build the Qt postgres drivers yourself. Refer to the Qt documentation for this.

For Linux, Qt postgres drivers are usually available as a convenience package. For example, in Ubuntu, it can be installed through 'apt-get install libqt4-sql-psql' at the console.
